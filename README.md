# Simulator for Multi-Neighborhood Cellular Automata

MNCA's are the next step of traditional cellular automata, for example, Conway's Game of Life. By using multiple neighborhoods instead of just one, there is an huge increase in the diversity of states that can emerge.

Because this is in Java it's not very fast when the images become really big so try not to go above 800x600px and more than 5 neighborhoods.
